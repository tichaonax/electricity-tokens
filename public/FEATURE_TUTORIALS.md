### Scenario: Someone bought tokens, now you need to pay your fair share

#### Step 1: Understanding What You're Doing

**Before Contributing**:

- Payment is based on your actual consumption (meter reading difference)

#### Step 2: Navigate to Contribution Form

1. **From Dashboard**: Click "Add Contribution" in notifications

```

**Choose the Purchase**: Click to select it

#### Step 4: Check Your Current Meter Reading

**This is the Most Important Step!**

1. **Go to your electricity meter**
2. **Write down the current reading**
   ```
   Example: If purchase was at 5000, and now shows 5025
   You've used: 25 kWh since the purchase
   ```

   Validation: Must be higher than purchase reading (5000)
   ```

2. **Contribution Amount** (Auto-calculated):

   ```
   System calculates: (25 √∑ 100) √ó $150.50 = $37.63
   Your usage: 25 tokens out of 100 total
   Your fair share: $37.63
   ```

3. **Review the Calculation**:
   ```
   Tokens Consumed: 25 kWh
   Your Share: 25%
   Rate per kWh: $1.51
   ```

#### Step 6: Adjust if Needed (Advanced)

**Why You Might Adjust**:

- Special arrangement with purchaser

2. **Click "Submit Contribution"**
3. **Look for success message**

## üîß Tutorial 7: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Self-Help Problem Solving

#### Problem: "I can't enter my meter reading"

**Common Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Reading too low**:

   ```
   Error: "Meter reading must be higher than purchase reading"
   Solution: Double-check your meter - make sure you're reading it correctly
   Purchase was at: 5000
   Your reading must be: >5000 (like 5025)
   ```

2. **Reading out of sequence**:

   ```
   Error: "Meter reading violates chronological order"
   Solution: Ensure your reading is higher than the most recent purchase
   Check: What was the last recorded meter reading?
   ```

3. **Reading too high**:
   ```
   Warning: "Unusually high consumption detected"
   Solution: Verify your meter reading is correct
   If correct: Proceed (might indicate meter issues or high usage)
   ```

#### Problem: "My contribution amount looks wrong"

**Debugging Steps**:

1. **Check the calculation**:

   ```
   Purchase: 100 tokens for $150
   Your usage: 25 tokens
   Expected share: (25 √∑ 100) √ó $150 = $37.50
   ```

2. **Verify meter readings**:
   - Purchase reading: 5000
   - Your reading: 5025
   - Consumption: 5025 - 5000 = 25 tokens ‚úì

3. **Check for emergency purchase premium**:
   - Emergency purchases cost more per kWh
   - Your share reflects the higher rate

#### Problem: "I can't see the Admin Panel"

**Requirements Check**:

1. **User role**: Must be ADMIN
2. **Check your role**: Profile ‚Üí Account Details
3. **Request admin access**: Contact current admin
4. **Log out and back in**: After role change

#### Problem: "The app is slow or not loading"

**Quick Fixes**:

1. **Refresh the page**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
