## üöÄ Getting Started

### Q: I'm new to this app. What exactly does it do?

**A:** Electricity Tokens Tracker helps households fairly split electricity costs based on actual usage. Here's how it works:

1. Someone buys electricity tokens (kWh) from the utility company
2. They enter the purchase details (tokens, cost, meter reading) in the app
3. Each household member records their meter reading and pays their fair share
4. The app calculates exactly how much electricity each person used
5. Everyone pays proportionally to their actual consumption

**Example**: If you used 25 kWh out of a 100 kWh purchase that cost $150, you pay (25√∑100) √ó $150 = $37.50.

### Q: Do I need to be tech-savvy to use this?

**A:** Not at all! The app is designed for everyone. You mainly need to:

- Take meter readings (just like reading a car odometer)
- Enter some numbers in simple forms
- Check your usage reports occasionally

The app guides you through each step and calculates everything automatically.

### Q: What's a "token" in this system?

**A:** A token represents 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity. It's a simple 1:1 relationship:

- **1 token = 1 kWh**
- If you buy "100 tokens," you bought 100 kWh of electricity
- Your electricity meter measures kWh, so the numbers match directly

### Q: How is this different from just splitting the electricity bill evenly?

**A:** **Fair vs. Equal**:

- **Equal split**: Everyone pays the same amount regardless of usage
- **Fair split (our system)**: Everyone pays based on actual consumption

**Example**:

```
3-person household, $150 electricity bill:
Equal split: $50 each (even if one person used 80% of the electricity)
Fair split: Person A used 60 kWh = $90, Person B used 25 kWh = $37.50, Person C used 15 kWh = $22.50
```

### Q: What if I'm the only one who knows how to buy electricity tokens?

**A:** That's common! You can:

1. Create all the purchases in the app
2. Others just need to contribute (much simpler)
3. The app tracks who owes what to whom
4. You get accurate records of all transactions

Many households have one "electricity manager" who handles purchases while others just contribute.

## ‚ö° Daily Usage

### Q: How often do I need to check my meter reading?

**A:** **Recommended frequency**:

- **After each purchase**: Essential for accurate tracking
- **Weekly**: Good for monitoring usage patterns
- **When contributing**: Required for fair cost calculation
- **Monthly**: Minimum for basic functionality

**Pro tip**: Set a weekly reminder on your phone. It takes 30 seconds but ensures accurate cost sharing.

### Q: I can't find my electricity meter or don't know how to read it

**A:** **Finding your meter**:

- Usually outside your home/apartment
- Sometimes in a utility room or basement
- May be in a shared meter room (apartments)
- Contact your utility company if you can't locate it

**Reading the meter**:

- Look for a digital display showing kWh
- Write down ALL the numbers before the decimal
- Some meters show extra digits - use the main reading
- Take a photo for reference

**Still confused?** Ask a neighbor, landlord, or utility company for help. Once you know how, it's easy!

### Q: What if my meter reading seems wrong?

**A:** **Common meter reading issues**:

**Reading looks too high**:

- Double-check you're reading the right meter
- Ensure you're reading kWh, not other measurements
- Look for unusual electricity usage (heater left on, etc.)
- Compare with previous readings for reasonableness

**Reading looks too low**:

- Make sure you're reading all digits
- Check if the meter reset (rare, but possible)
- Verify you're reading the current reading, not historical data

**The app says "invalid reading"**:

- Your reading must be higher than the last purchase reading
- Check that you're reading in chronological order
- Contact admin if you're certain your reading is correct

### Q: What happens if I forget to contribute to a purchase?

**A:** **No problem!** You can contribute any time:

1. The app tracks all pending contributions
2. Your dashboard shows what you owe
3. You can contribute weeks or months later
4. The system maintains accurate balance tracking

**However**: Contributing promptly is courteous and helps with household cash flow.

### Q: Can I contribute more than my fair share?

**A:** **Yes!** You might want to:

- Round up for convenience ($37.63 ‚Üí $40)
- Overpay to simplify future transactions
- Cover someone else who's short on cash

The app tracks overpayments and shows your positive balance. Others owe you money until it balances out.

### Q: What if someone never contributes?

**A:** **The app tracks everything**:

- Admins can see who owes money
- Balance reports show overdue amounts
- Audit logs track all activity (or lack thereof)

**Household solutions**:

- Set up friendly reminders
- Establish house rules about contribution timing
- Use the app's notification features
- Have a monthly "settlement" meeting

## üí∞ Cost & Billing

### Q: How exactly is my fair share calculated?

**A:** **The formula is simple and transparent**:

```
Your Fair Share = (Your Tokens Used √∑ Total Tokens) √ó Total Cost

Example:
Purchase: 100 tokens for $150
You used: 25 tokens
Your share: (25 √∑ 100) √ó $150 = $37.50
Your rate: $37.50 √∑ 25 = $1.50 per kWh
```

**Why this is fair**:

- Based on actual consumption, not estimates
- Proportional to real usage
- Transparent calculation everyone can verify
- No hidden fees or arbitrary splits

### Q: Why is my rate per kWh different from others?

**A:** **Several factors affect individual rates**:

1. **Timing of consumption**:
   - You benefit from purchases made when you were using electricity
   - Someone who uses electricity after their own purchase pays their own rate

2. **Emergency purchases**:
   - If you contribute to an emergency purchase, you pay the higher emergency rate
   - People who don't use emergency tokens pay standard rates

3. **Bulk purchase benefits**:
   - Larger purchases often have better rates
   - If you consume during a bulk purchase, you get the better rate

**Example**:

```
Purchase A: 50 tokens for $80 (rate: $1.60/kWh) - Emergency
Purchase B: 200 tokens for $280 (rate: $1.40/kWh) - Bulk

If you used 25 tokens from Purchase A: Your rate = $1.60/kWh
If you used 25 tokens from Purchase B: Your rate = $1.40/kWh
```

### Q: I think I'm overpaying. How can I check?

**A:** **Use the app's built-in tools**:

1. **Check your balance**: Dashboard shows if you're ahead or behind
2. **Review reports**: Reports ‚Üí Financial ‚Üí Balance Analysis
3. **Compare rates**: See if your rate is higher than household average
4. **Audit your contributions**: Review each contribution for accuracy

**Common overpayment causes**:

- Rounding up contributions for convenience
- Contributing to expensive emergency purchases
- Meter reading errors (reading too high)
- Contributing more than calculated fair share

**If you're consistently overpaying**:

- Others in your household owe you money
- You might be reading your meter incorrectly
- There might be an issue with the cost calculations

### Q: What happens if I underpay or don't pay at all?

**A:** **The app tracks everything**:

1. **Immediate effects**:
   - Your balance shows negative amount
   - Dashboard shows what you owe
   - Admins can see unpaid contributions

2. **Household impact**:
   - Others cover your share temporarily
   - Creates imbalance in cost sharing
   - May affect group dynamics

3. **System tracking**:
   - Complete audit trail of missing payments
   - Balance reports show historical underpayments
   - No automatic penalties, but everything is recorded

**Best practice**: Communicate with your household if you can't pay immediately. Most groups are understanding if you're upfront about timing.

### Q: Can I see how much everyone else is paying?

**A:** **Privacy vs. transparency balance**:

**What you CAN see**:

- Your own complete payment history
- Your balance vs. the group
- Your usage compared to household average
- Whether you're above or below average in costs

**What you CAN'T see** (regular users):

- Other people's specific payment amounts
- Individual meter readings
- Personal contribution details

**What ADMINS can see**:

- All user payment details
- Complete household financial overview
- Individual usage patterns
- Balance tracking for all users

This protects privacy while maintaining transparency about fair cost sharing.
