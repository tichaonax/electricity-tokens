## üìù Tutorial 3: Contributing to a Purchase (Most Important!)

### Scenario: Someone bought tokens, now you need to pay your fair share

#### Step 1: Understanding What You're Doing

**Before Contributing**:
- Someone in your household bought electricity tokens
- You need to pay for the electricity you've used since that purchase
- Payment is based on your actual consumption (meter reading difference)

#### Step 2: Navigate to Contribution Form
1. **From Dashboard**: Click "Add Contribution" in notifications
   - OR -
2. **From Menu**: Click "Contribute" in navigation
   - OR -
3. **From Notification**: Click the notification about pending contributions

#### Step 3: Select Which Purchase to Contribute To

**Purchase Dropdown Shows**:
```
Purchase #123 - Jan 15, 2024
100 tokens for $150.50 (Meter: 5000)
[No contribution yet] ‚Üê You haven't contributed
```

**Choose the Purchase**: Click to select it

#### Step 4: Check Your Current Meter Reading

**This is the Most Important Step!**

1. **Go to your electricity meter**
2. **Write down the current reading**
   ```
   Example: If purchase was at 5000, and now shows 5025
   You've used: 25 kWh since the purchase
   ```
3. **Double-check the number** (errors here affect everyone's costs)

#### Step 5: Fill Out Contribution Form

**Form Fields**:

1. **Current Meter Reading**:
   ```
   Example: 5025
   Validation: Must be higher than purchase reading (5000)
   ```

2. **Contribution Amount** (Auto-calculated):
   ```
   System calculates: (25 √∑ 100) √ó $150.50 = $37.63
   Your usage: 25 tokens out of 100 total
   Your fair share: $37.63
   ```

3. **Review the Calculation**:
   ```
   Tokens Consumed: 25 kWh
   Your Share: 25%
   Rate per kWh: $1.51
   ```

#### Step 6: Adjust if Needed (Advanced)

**Why You Might Adjust**:
- Special arrangement with purchaser
- You want to overpay for convenience
- Rounding for easier payment

**How to Adjust**:
1. **Manual Entry**: Uncheck "Use calculated amount"
2. **Enter your preferred amount**
3. **System will note the difference**

#### Step 7: Submit Contribution

1. **Review all information**
2. **Click "Submit Contribution"**
3. **Look for success message**

**What Happens Next**:
- Your contribution is recorded
- Your balance is updated
- Original purchaser is notified
- You'll see it in your Recent Activity

**üí° Expert Tips**:
- Contribute within a few days of the purchase
- If your meter reading seems wrong, double-check before submitting
- You can't contribute twice to the same purchase (one-to-one relationship)
- If you make an error, contact an admin to fix it

## üîß Tutorial 7: Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Self-Help Problem Solving

#### Problem: "I can't enter my meter reading"

**Common Causes and Solutions**:

1. **Reading too low**:
   ```
   Error: "Meter reading must be higher than purchase reading"
   Solution: Double-check your meter - make sure you're reading it correctly
   Purchase was at: 5000
   Your reading must be: >5000 (like 5025)
   ```

2. **Reading out of sequence**:
   ```
   Error: "Meter reading violates chronological order"
   Solution: Ensure your reading is higher than the most recent purchase
   Check: What was the last recorded meter reading?
   ```

3. **Reading too high**:
   ```
   Warning: "Unusually high consumption detected"
   Solution: Verify your meter reading is correct
   If correct: Proceed (might indicate meter issues or high usage)
   ```

#### Problem: "My contribution amount looks wrong"

**Debugging Steps**:

1. **Check the calculation**:
   ```
   Purchase: 100 tokens for $150
   Your usage: 25 tokens
   Expected share: (25 √∑ 100) √ó $150 = $37.50
   ```

2. **Verify meter readings**:
   - Purchase reading: 5000
   - Your reading: 5025
   - Consumption: 5025 - 5000 = 25 tokens ‚úì

3. **Check for emergency purchase premium**:
   - Emergency purchases cost more per kWh
   - Your share reflects the higher rate

#### Problem: "I can't see the Admin Panel"

**Requirements Check**:
1. **User role**: Must be ADMIN
2. **Check your role**: Profile ‚Üí Account Details
3. **Request admin access**: Contact current admin
