### Manual Windows Commands

Services created with the hybrid approach are full Windows services and can be managed through:

- **Windows Services Management Console**: `services.msc` (service will be visible as "ElectricityTokensTracker")
- **SC commands**: `sc.exe start/stop/query "ElectricityTokensTracker"`
- **NET commands**: `NET START` / `NET STOP "ElectricityTokensTracker"`
- **PowerShell**: `Get-Service`, `Start-Service`, `Stop-Service`

However, it's recommended to use the npm scripts as they provide better error handling and logging.

## üìä Monitoring and Logs

### File Logs

Service logs are written to:

```
<app-root>/logs/service.log
```

### Windows Event Viewer

1. Open Windows Event Viewer
2. Navigate to: Windows Logs ‚Üí Application
3. Filter by Source: "ElectricityTokensTracker"

### Log Levels

- **INFO**: Normal operation messages
- **WARN**: Warning conditions
- **ERROR**: Error conditions

## üîß Configuration

### Service Configuration

Edit `scripts/windows-service/config.js` to customize:

```javascript
const SERVICE_CONFIG = {
  name: 'ElectricityTokensTracker',
  description: 'Your custom description',

  // Port configuration
  env: {
    PORT: 3000,
    NODE_ENV: 'production',
    // Add your environment variables here
  },

  // Recovery options
  restart: {
    delay: 60000, // Restart delay in milliseconds
    attempts: 3, // Max restart attempts per hour
  },
};
```

### Environment Variables

The service inherits environment variables from the installation context. For production deployments, consider:

1. **System Environment Variables**: Set via Windows System Properties
2. **Service Account**: Configure service to run under specific account
3. **Startup Type**: Automatic (default) or Manual

## üîÑ Deploying Updates

### Automated Upgrade (Recommended)

For seamless deployments with automatic backup and verification:

```bash
# Open PowerShell or Command Prompt as Administrator
npm run service:upgrade
```

This automated process handles:

- ‚úÖ Creates backup of current application
- ‚úÖ Stops service gracefully
- ‚úÖ Updates dependencies and rebuilds application
- ‚úÖ Starts service and verifies functionality
- ‚úÖ Provides rollback path if issues occur

**Typical downtime**: 2-5 minutes

### Manual Deployment

When you need more control over the process:

1. **Stop the service**:

   ```bash
   npm run service:stop
   ```

2. **Update your code** (git pull, etc.)

3. **Install new dependencies** (if any):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build the application**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Start the service**:
   ```bash
   npm run service:start
   ```

### Rollback if Needed

If an upgrade fails or causes issues:

```bash
# Find backup directory
dir backups\

# Rollback to previous version
npm run service:rollback "C:\path\to\backup\backup-2024-01-15T10-30-00-123Z"
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Service Installation Issues

1. **Validate environment first**:

   ```bash
   npm run service:validate
   ```

2. **Check if node-windows is properly installed**:

   ```bash
   npm install node-windows --save
   ```

3. **Ensure administrator privileges**: Service installation requires admin rights

4. **Check Windows Event Viewer**: Look for service installation errors

#### Upgrade/Deployment Issues

1. **Husky setup issues during upgrade**:

   ```bash
   # Fix husky configuration
   npm run service:fix-husky

   # Then retry upgrade
   npm run service:upgrade
   ```

2. **npm install failures**:
   - The upgrade script now handles common npm issues automatically
   - Uses `--no-audit --no-fund` flags to speed up installation
   - Falls back to `--ignore-scripts` if prepare scripts fail

#### Service Won't Start

1. Check if running as Administrator
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Check Windows Event Viewer for detailed errors
4. Ensure database is accessible
5. Verify Node.js path is correct

#### Database Connection Issues

1. Check DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Verify database server is running
3. Test connection from service account context
4. Check network connectivity and firewall rules

#### Port Already in Use

1. Check what's using the port: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000`
2. Change PORT environment variable
3. Stop conflicting applications

#### Permission Issues

1. Service runs as SYSTEM by default
2. Database/file permissions may need adjustment
3. Consider running service under specific account

### Diagnostic Commands

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version

# Test application manually
npm run build
npm start

# Check environment variables
set | findstr DATABASE_URL

# Test database connection
npm run db:setup
```

### Log Analysis

Check the service log for common patterns:

```bash
# View recent logs
type logs\service.log | findstr /C:"ERROR"
type logs\service.log | findstr /C:"WARN"
```
