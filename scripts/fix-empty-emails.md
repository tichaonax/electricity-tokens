# Email Data Integrity Fix

## Issue
When the admin email functionality was first implemented, there was a potential for emails to be accidentally cleared during form submissions, leaving users with empty email addresses.

## Protection Added
1. **Frontend Validation**: Both admin edit page and profile page now validate emails before submission
2. **Backend Validation**: API now rejects empty emails and validates format
3. **Required Fields**: Email inputs are marked as required

## If Users Have Empty Emails

### Check for Empty Emails (Admin Console)
```bash
# Connect to your database and run:
SELECT id, name, email, role FROM users WHERE email IS NULL OR email = '';
```

### Fix Empty Emails (Admin Console)
```bash
# Update users with empty emails to a temporary email:
UPDATE users 
SET email = CONCAT('temp_', id, '@example.com') 
WHERE email IS NULL OR email = '';
```

### Manual Fix via Admin Interface
1. Go to Admin Panel â†’ User Management
2. Edit each user with empty email
3. Set a proper email address
4. Save changes

## Prevention
- All forms now validate email addresses before submission
- API rejects empty emails with clear error messages
- Required attributes prevent accidental empty submissions

## Recommendation
1. Check your database for users with empty emails
2. Fix them manually through the admin interface or database
3. The new validation will prevent this issue going forward
