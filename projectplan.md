- Create data consistency checks and automated alerts

### Performance Optimization

- Index frequently queried database columns
- Implement caching for report generation
- Optimize queries for large datasets
- Use pagination for large data lists

### Scalability

- Design database schema to handle growth
- Implement efficient query patterns
- Consider database sharding if user base grows significantly
- Plan for horizontal scaling of Next.js application

### Security Best Practices

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
