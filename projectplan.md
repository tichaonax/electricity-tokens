# Project Plan: Database Migration Integration in Windows Service

## Problem Statement

The Windows service needs to run database migrations before starting the application to ensure the code is in sync with any potential database changes. Currently, migrations run within the service startup, but we need to ensure they complete successfully before the application starts.

## Current Architecture Analysis

The service uses a hybrid architecture with these key components:

- `service-wrapper-hybrid.js` - Main service wrapper that starts Next.js directly
- `hybrid-service-manager.js` - Service management and process control
- Database migrations already run in `runDatabaseMigrations()` at `service-wrapper-hybrid.js:714-877`

## Current Migration Flow

âœ… Migrations currently run in the correct location (before app startup in `startApplication()`)
âœ… Migration process includes status checking, deployment, and Prisma client generation
âœ… Error handling exists for baseline scenarios and timeout protection
âœ… Service logs migration progress appropriately

## Analysis Result

**The system already implements the requested feature correctly!**

Database migrations run in `service-wrapper-hybrid.js` at line 1013 within `startApplication()` method, which:

1. **Checks rebuild requirements first** (lines 996-1007)
2. **Runs production build if needed** (lines 1000-1004)
3. **Verifies Next.js availability** (line 1010)
4. **ðŸŽ¯ RUNS DATABASE MIGRATIONS** (line 1013)
5. **Only then starts the Next.js application** (lines 1019+)

## Todo Items

### âœ… Task 1: Examine current Windows service architecture and files

- [x] Located service files in `scripts/windows-service/`
- [x] Identified key components: service-wrapper-hybrid.js, hybrid-service-manager.js
- [x] Found existing migration integration

### âœ… Task 2: Read service wrapper and management files

- [x] Analyzed `service-wrapper-hybrid.js` - main service wrapper
- [x] Reviewed `hybrid-service-manager.js` - service management
- [x] Found `runDatabaseMigrations()` method already implemented

### âœ… Task 3: Create plan for migration integration

- [x] **DISCOVERED: Feature already implemented correctly!**
- [x] Migrations run at line 1013 in proper sequence before app startup
- [x] Includes comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] No changes needed - system works as requested

## Conclusion

**No changes are required.** The Windows service already correctly runs database migrations before starting the application. The implementation includes:

- âœ… Migration status checking
- âœ… Migration deployment with `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- âœ… Prisma client regeneration
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling for baseline scenarios
- âœ… Timeout protection (5 minutes)
- âœ… Proper logging throughout the process
- âœ… App startup only occurs after successful migration completion

The existing code at `service-wrapper-hybrid.js:1013` ensures migrations are always executed before the Next.js application starts, which satisfies the user's requirement.

## Issue Resolution

### Problem Encountered

During testing, discovered a `TypeError: routesManifest.dataRoutes is not iterable` error in Next.js 15.5.2.

### Root Cause

The routes-manifest.json file was missing the `dataRoutes` property that Next.js 15.5.2 expects.

### Solution Applied

Performed a fresh production build using `npm run build` which regenerated the routes-manifest.json with the correct structure, including the missing `dataRoutes: []` property.

### Final Status: âœ… RESOLVED

The Windows service now:

- âœ… Runs database migrations before app startup (as originally requested)
- âœ… Handles build requirements automatically
- âœ… Successfully starts Next.js on port 3000
- âœ… Provides comprehensive logging of the migration process
- âœ… No longer encounters the routesManifest.dataRoutes error

The migration integration was already correctly implemented - the issue was a Next.js build compatibility problem that has been resolved.
