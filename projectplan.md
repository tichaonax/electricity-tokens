## üîç Database Structure Analysis (July 5, 2025)

### **Current Data Architecture Understanding**

After examining the codebase, here's a comprehensive breakdown of the database structure and data relationships:

#### **Core Tables & Relationships**

1. **TokenPurchase** (`token_purchases`)
   - **Purpose**: Represents actual electricity token purchases
   - **Key Fields**: 
     - `totalTokens`: Amount of electricity tokens purchased
     - `totalPayment`: Total cost of the purchase
     - `meterReading`: Initial meter reading when purchase was made
     - `isEmergency`: Boolean flag for higher-cost emergency purchases
     - `purchaseDate`: When the purchase was made
   - **Relationship**: One-to-one with UserContribution

2. **UserContribution** (`user_contributions`)
   - **Purpose**: Individual user's participation in shared purchases
   - **Key Fields**:
     - `purchaseId`: Links to a specific purchase (unique constraint)
     - `userId`: Which user this contribution belongs to
     - `contributionAmount`: How much the user paid
     - `meterReading`: User's meter reading at time of contribution
     - `tokensConsumed`: Calculated usage (current - purchase initial reading)
   - **Relationship**: One-to-one with TokenPurchase, Many-to-one with User

3. **MeterReading** (`meter_readings`)
   - **Purpose**: Historical meter reading records
   - **Key Fields**: `reading`, `readingDate`, `userId`
   - **Relationship**: Many-to-one with User

#### **Data Flow & Business Logic**

**Purchase Process:**
1. Someone makes a **TokenPurchase** (buys electricity tokens)
2. A **UserContribution** is created linking a user to that purchase
3. The system calculates `tokensConsumed` = current meter reading - purchase initial reading
4. User pays a `contributionAmount` which may differ from their proportional cost

**Cost Calculation Logic:**
- **Proportional Cost**: `(tokensUsed / totalTokensInPurchase) * totalPurchaseCost`
- **True Cost vs Paid Amount**: Tracks overpayment/underpayment
- **Emergency Premium**: Additional cost for emergency purchases
- **Efficiency**: Percentage of how well payments match actual usage

#### **Dashboard API Data Query Pattern**

The existing dashboard API (`/src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts`) focuses on **UserContributions** as the primary data source:

```typescript
// Primary query - gets user contributions with purchase data
const contributions = await prisma.userContribution.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: targetUserId,
    createdAt: { gte: historyStart }  // Filters by contribution date
  },
  include: {
    purchase: true,  // Includes purchase details
    user: { select: { id: true, name: true } }
  }
});
```

### **Key Insights for June Data Issue**

#### **Why June Data Might Not Appear**

1. **Date Filtering**: Dashboard filters by `createdAt` date on contributions, not purchase dates
2. **Default Time Range**: Uses `monthsBack` parameter (default 6 months) from current date
3. **User-Specific Data**: Only shows contributions for the authenticated user
4. **Contribution vs Purchase Dates**: System filters by when contribution was recorded, not when purchase was made

#### **Data Structure Implications**

**Contributions vs Purchases:**
- **Contributions**: Individual user's electricity usage and payments (what dashboard shows)
- **Purchases**: Actual token purchases made (shared resource)
- **Key Difference**: Dashboard focuses on user-specific usage patterns, not purchase history

**Current Schema Constraints:**
- One-to-one relationship between Purchase and Contribution (enforced by unique constraint)
- This means the system has evolved from shared purchases to individual purchases
- Each purchase now has exactly one associated contribution

### **Debugging June Data - Action Items**

#### **Immediate Checks Needed**

1. **Verify Data Existence**: Check if June contributions exist in database
2. **Check Date Ranges**: Ensure widget date calculations include June
3. **User Association**: Verify contributions are linked to correct user
4. **Widget vs Dashboard Logic**: Compare how widgets query data vs dashboard API

#### **Database Queries to Run**

```sql
-- Check for June contributions
SELECT * FROM user_contributions 
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', createdAt) = '2025-06-01' 
AND userId = 'target_user_id';

-- Check for June purchases
SELECT * FROM token_purchases 
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', purchaseDate) = '2025-06-01';

-- Check user's recent contributions
SELECT * FROM user_contributions 
WHERE userId = 'target_user_id' 
ORDER BY createdAt DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Cost Calculation Engine**

The system uses a sophisticated cost calculation engine (`/src/lib/cost-calculations.ts`) that:

1. **Handles Proportional Costs**: Calculates fair share based on actual usage
2. **Manages Emergency Rates**: Tracks higher costs for emergency purchases
3. **Calculates Running Balance**: Tracks overpayment/underpayment over time
4. **Provides Efficiency Metrics**: Shows how well payments align with usage

### **Recommendation for Widget Implementation**

**For new widgets to work correctly:**
1. **Use UserContribution queries**: Follow the same pattern as dashboard API
2. **Include purchase data**: Use `include: { purchase: true }` for cost calculations
3. **Filter by contribution dates**: Use `createdAt` for time-based filtering
4. **Apply user-specific filtering**: Ensure widgets show user's own data

## üîç Wrapper Components Analysis and Removal Plan (July 6, 2025)

### Project Goal
Identify and remove unnecessary wrapper components in the codebase that serve as simple abstraction layers without adding significant value. This will simplify the codebase and reduce unnecessary indirection.

### Analysis Summary

After searching through the codebase, I've identified several wrapper components that can be simplified by direct imports:

#### 1. Confirmed Wrapper Components Found

**A. Client Components (Unnecessarily Complex)**
- **`dashboard-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **`cost-analysis-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/cost-analysis/page.tsx`  
- **`contributions-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/contributions/page.tsx`
- **`data-management-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/data-management/page.tsx`
- **`new-contribution-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/contributions/new/page.tsx`

**B. Wrapper Components (Dynamic Import Wrappers)**
- **`dashboard-wrapper.tsx`** - Dynamically imports `DashboardClient` with SSR disabled
- **`cost-analysis-wrapper.tsx`** - Dynamically imports `CostAnalysisClient` with SSR disabled

#### 2. Pages Using Wrapper Components

All of these pages are simple one-liner imports that could be simplified:

1. `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `DashboardClient`
2. `/src/app/dashboard/cost-analysis/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `CostAnalysisClient`
3. `/src/app/dashboard/contributions/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `ContributionsClient`
4. `/src/app/dashboard/data-management/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `DataManagementClient`
5. `/src/app/dashboard/contributions/new/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `NewContributionClient`

#### 3. Underlying Components That Could Be Used Directly

- **`cost-analysis.tsx`** - The actual implementation used by `CostAnalysisClient`
- Main dashboard functionality is embedded in `DashboardClient` (no separate component)
- Contribution functionality is embedded in `ContributionsClient` (no separate component)
- Data management functionality is embedded in `DataManagementClient` (no separate component)
- New contribution functionality is embedded in `NewContributionClient` (no separate component)

#### 4. Simplification Opportunities

The main simplification opportunity is with:
- **Cost Analysis**: We can use `CostAnalysis` component directly instead of `CostAnalysisClient`
- **Wrapper files**: Remove the `-wrapper.tsx` files entirely as they're not being used
- **Client files**: For most client files, they serve as page-level components that handle session management and routing

### Todo Items

- [ ] **Remove unused wrapper files** - Delete `dashboard-wrapper.tsx` and `cost-analysis-wrapper.tsx` (they're not being used)
- [ ] **Simplify cost analysis page** - Replace `CostAnalysisClient` import with direct `CostAnalysis` component usage
- [ ] **Evaluate client components** - Determine if the session management and routing logic in client components should be moved to page level
- [ ] **Update imports** - Update page files to use simplified imports
- [ ] **Test functionality** - Ensure all pages work correctly after simplification
- [ ] **Clean up unused files** - Remove any wrapper component files that are no longer needed

### Direct Import Alternatives

**For Cost Analysis:**
**Current:**
```tsx
import { CostAnalysisClient } from '@/components/cost-analysis-client';
```

**Alternative:**
```tsx
import { CostAnalysis } from '@/components/cost-analysis';
// Add session management and navigation directly in page
```

**For Other Components:**
Most other "client" components contain significant page-level logic (session management, routing, navigation) that may be appropriate to keep at the component level. However, they could potentially be simplified by:

1. Moving session logic to page level
2. Using the underlying business logic components directly
3. Reducing the abstraction layers

### Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Low Risk):**
- Remove unused wrapper files (`dashboard-wrapper.tsx`, `cost-analysis-wrapper.tsx`)
- Simplify cost analysis page to use `CostAnalysis` directly

**Phase 2 (Medium Risk):**
- Evaluate whether client components' session/routing logic should be moved to page level
- Consider if the abstraction provided by client components is valuable

**Phase 3 (Optional):**
- If client components are determined to be unnecessary wrappers, move their logic to page components and use business logic components directly

### Implementation Notes

- All changes should be tested to ensure functionality remains intact
- Session management and authentication logic should be preserved
- Navigation functionality must be maintained
- Consider the SSR implications when removing dynamic imports
