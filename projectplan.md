## üîç Database Structure Analysis (July 5, 2025)

### **Current Data Architecture Understanding**

After examining the codebase, here's a comprehensive breakdown of the database structure and data relationships:

#### **Core Tables & Relationships**

1. **TokenPurchase** (`token_purchases`)
   - **Purpose**: Represents actual electricity token purchases
   - **Key Fields**: 
     - `totalTokens`: Amount of electricity tokens purchased
     - `totalPayment`: Total cost of the purchase
     - `meterReading`: Initial meter reading when purchase was made
     - `isEmergency`: Boolean flag for higher-cost emergency purchases
     - `purchaseDate`: When the purchase was made
   - **Relationship**: One-to-one with UserContribution

2. **UserContribution** (`user_contributions`)
   - **Purpose**: Individual user's participation in shared purchases
   - **Key Fields**:
     - `purchaseId`: Links to a specific purchase (unique constraint)
     - `userId`: Which user this contribution belongs to
     - `contributionAmount`: How much the user paid
     - `meterReading`: User's meter reading at time of contribution
     - `tokensConsumed`: Calculated usage (current - purchase initial reading)
   - **Relationship**: One-to-one with TokenPurchase, Many-to-one with User

3. **MeterReading** (`meter_readings`)
   - **Purpose**: Historical meter reading records
   - **Key Fields**: `reading`, `readingDate`, `userId`
   - **Relationship**: Many-to-one with User

#### **Data Flow & Business Logic**

**Purchase Process:**
1. Someone makes a **TokenPurchase** (buys electricity tokens)
2. A **UserContribution** is created linking a user to that purchase
3. The system calculates `tokensConsumed` = current meter reading - purchase initial reading
4. User pays a `contributionAmount` which may differ from their proportional cost

**Cost Calculation Logic:**
- **Proportional Cost**: `(tokensUsed / totalTokensInPurchase) * totalPurchaseCost`
- **True Cost vs Paid Amount**: Tracks overpayment/underpayment
- **Emergency Premium**: Additional cost for emergency purchases
- **Efficiency**: Percentage of how well payments match actual usage

#### **Dashboard API Data Query Pattern**

The existing dashboard API (`/src/app/api/dashboard/route.ts`) focuses on **UserContributions** as the primary data source:

```typescript
// Primary query - gets user contributions with purchase data
const contributions = await prisma.userContribution.findMany({
  where: {
    userId: targetUserId,
    createdAt: { gte: historyStart }  // Filters by contribution date
  },
  include: {
    purchase: true,  // Includes purchase details
    user: { select: { id: true, name: true } }
  }
});
```

### **Key Insights for June Data Issue**

#### **Why June Data Might Not Appear**

1. **Date Filtering**: Dashboard filters by `createdAt` date on contributions, not purchase dates
2. **Default Time Range**: Uses `monthsBack` parameter (default 6 months) from current date
3. **User-Specific Data**: Only shows contributions for the authenticated user
4. **Contribution vs Purchase Dates**: System filters by when contribution was recorded, not when purchase was made

#### **Data Structure Implications**

**Contributions vs Purchases:**
- **Contributions**: Individual user's electricity usage and payments (what dashboard shows)
- **Purchases**: Actual token purchases made (shared resource)
- **Key Difference**: Dashboard focuses on user-specific usage patterns, not purchase history

**Current Schema Constraints:**
- One-to-one relationship between Purchase and Contribution (enforced by unique constraint)
- This means the system has evolved from shared purchases to individual purchases
- Each purchase now has exactly one associated contribution

### **Debugging June Data - Action Items**

#### **Immediate Checks Needed**

1. **Verify Data Existence**: Check if June contributions exist in database
2. **Check Date Ranges**: Ensure widget date calculations include June
3. **User Association**: Verify contributions are linked to correct user
4. **Widget vs Dashboard Logic**: Compare how widgets query data vs dashboard API

#### **Database Queries to Run**

```sql
-- Check for June contributions
SELECT * FROM user_contributions 
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', createdAt) = '2025-06-01' 
AND userId = 'target_user_id';

-- Check for June purchases
SELECT * FROM token_purchases 
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', purchaseDate) = '2025-06-01';

-- Check user's recent contributions
SELECT * FROM user_contributions 
WHERE userId = 'target_user_id' 
ORDER BY createdAt DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

### **Cost Calculation Engine**

The system uses a sophisticated cost calculation engine (`/src/lib/cost-calculations.ts`) that:

1. **Handles Proportional Costs**: Calculates fair share based on actual usage
2. **Manages Emergency Rates**: Tracks higher costs for emergency purchases
3. **Calculates Running Balance**: Tracks overpayment/underpayment over time
4. **Provides Efficiency Metrics**: Shows how well payments align with usage

### **Recommendation for Widget Implementation**

**For new widgets to work correctly:**
1. **Use UserContribution queries**: Follow the same pattern as dashboard API
2. **Include purchase data**: Use `include: { purchase: true }` for cost calculations
3. **Filter by contribution dates**: Use `createdAt` for time-based filtering
4. **Apply user-specific filtering**: Ensure widgets show user's own data

## üîç Wrapper Components Analysis and Removal Plan (July 6, 2025)

### Project Goal
Identify and remove unnecessary wrapper components in the codebase that serve as simple abstraction layers without adding significant value. This will simplify the codebase and reduce unnecessary indirection.

### Analysis Summary

After searching through the codebase, I've identified several wrapper components that can be simplified by direct imports:

#### 1. Confirmed Wrapper Components Found

**A. Client Components (Unnecessarily Complex)**
- **`dashboard-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- **`cost-analysis-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/cost-analysis/page.tsx`  
- **`contributions-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/contributions/page.tsx`
- **`data-management-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/data-management/page.tsx`
- **`new-contribution-client.tsx`** - Used by `/src/app/dashboard/contributions/new/page.tsx`

**B. Wrapper Components (Dynamic Import Wrappers)**
- **`dashboard-wrapper.tsx`** - Dynamically imports `DashboardClient` with SSR disabled
- **`cost-analysis-wrapper.tsx`** - Dynamically imports `CostAnalysisClient` with SSR disabled

#### 2. Pages Using Wrapper Components

All of these pages are simple one-liner imports that could be simplified:

1. `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `DashboardClient`
2. `/src/app/dashboard/cost-analysis/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `CostAnalysisClient`
3. `/src/app/dashboard/contributions/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `ContributionsClient`
4. `/src/app/dashboard/data-management/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `DataManagementClient`
5. `/src/app/dashboard/contributions/new/page.tsx` ‚Üí imports `NewContributionClient`

#### 3. Underlying Components That Could Be Used Directly

- **`cost-analysis.tsx`** - The actual implementation used by `CostAnalysisClient`
- Main dashboard functionality is embedded in `DashboardClient` (no separate component)
- Contribution functionality is embedded in `ContributionsClient` (no separate component)
- Data management functionality is embedded in `DataManagementClient` (no separate component)
- New contribution functionality is embedded in `NewContributionClient` (no separate component)

#### 4. Simplification Opportunities

The main simplification opportunity is with:
- **Cost Analysis**: We can use `CostAnalysis` component directly instead of `CostAnalysisClient`
- **Wrapper files**: Remove the `-wrapper.tsx` files entirely as they're not being used
- **Client files**: For most client files, they serve as page-level components that handle session management and routing

### Todo Items

- [ ] **Remove unused wrapper files** - Delete `dashboard-wrapper.tsx` and `cost-analysis-wrapper.tsx` (they're not being used)
- [ ] **Simplify cost analysis page** - Replace `CostAnalysisClient` import with direct `CostAnalysis` component usage
- [ ] **Evaluate client components** - Determine if the session management and routing logic in client components should be moved to page level
- [ ] **Update imports** - Update page files to use simplified imports
- [ ] **Test functionality** - Ensure all pages work correctly after simplification
- [ ] **Clean up unused files** - Remove any wrapper component files that are no longer needed

### Direct Import Alternatives

**For Cost Analysis:**
**Current:**
```tsx
import { CostAnalysisClient } from '@/components/cost-analysis-client';
```

**Alternative:**
```tsx
import { CostAnalysis } from '@/components/cost-analysis';
// Add session management and navigation directly in page
```

**For Other Components:**
Most other "client" components contain significant page-level logic (session management, routing, navigation) that may be appropriate to keep at the component level. However, they could potentially be simplified by:

1. Moving session logic to page level
2. Using the underlying business logic components directly
3. Reducing the abstraction layers

### Recommendation

**Phase 1 (Low Risk):**
- Remove unused wrapper files (`dashboard-wrapper.tsx`, `cost-analysis-wrapper.tsx`)
- Simplify cost analysis page to use `CostAnalysis` directly

**Phase 2 (Medium Risk):**
- Evaluate whether client components' session/routing logic should be moved to page level
- Consider if the abstraction provided by client components is valuable

**Phase 3 (Optional):**
- If client components are determined to be unnecessary wrappers, move their logic to page components and use business logic components directly

### Implementation Notes

- All changes should be tested to ensure functionality remains intact
- Session management and authentication logic should be preserved
- Navigation functionality must be maintained
- Consider the SSR implications when removing dynamic imports

## üîç Account Balance Calculation Investigation (July 6, 2025)

### Problem Analysis
The user reports incorrect account balance calculations after a new meter reading:
- New meter reading: 1362 kWh (7/6/25)
- Previous meter reading: 1348.5 kWh  
- Consumption: 13.5 kWh
- Account Balance shows: -$4.75 owed
- Anticipated Next Payment shows: -$7.44

The anticipated payment should be much higher since significant consumption (13.5+ kWh) just occurred.

### Current Architecture Understanding

#### Data Flow
1. **MeterReading** table stores actual meter readings with dates
2. **UserContribution** table stores consumption records linked to purchases
3. **TokenPurchase** table stores token purchases with rates
4. **Running Balance API** (`/api/dashboard/running-balance`) calculates account balance

#### Key Issues Identified

1. **Disconnect between MeterReading and UserContribution**:
   - MeterReading stores actual readings (1362 kWh)
   - UserContribution stores consumption at time of purchase/contribution
   - No automatic linkage between latest meter reading and balance calculation

2. **Running Balance Logic Problem**:
   - Line 124-125 in `/src/app/api/dashboard/running-balance/route.ts`:
   ```typescript
   tokensConsumedSinceLastContribution = Math.max(0, latestMeterReading.reading - latestContribution.meterReading);
   ```
   - This correctly calculates consumption since last contribution
   - But the anticipated payment calculation may have issues

3. **Account Balance Calculation**:
   - Uses global contributions (all users) instead of user-specific
   - Line 22: `const contributions = await prisma.userContribution.findMany({` (no user filter)
   - This is intentional for system-wide balance but may confuse users

### Investigation Plan

#### Phase 1: Data Verification
- [ ] Check actual database values for the specific user
- [ ] Verify meter reading 1362 kWh is recorded in MeterReading table
- [ ] Check latest UserContribution record and its meterReading value
- [ ] Verify calculation: 1362 - 1348.5 = 13.5 kWh consumption

#### Phase 2: Logic Analysis
- [ ] Trace through running balance calculation step by step
- [ ] Verify `tokensConsumedSinceLastContribution` calculation
- [ ] Check `estimatedCostSinceLastContribution` calculation  
- [ ] Verify `anticipatedPayment` calculation logic

#### Phase 3: Cost Calculation Review
- [ ] Check `historicalCostPerKwh` calculation
- [ ] Verify if 13.5 kWh √ó historical rate = expected cost
- [ ] Check if balance calculation accounts for new consumption properly

#### Phase 4: User-Specific vs Global Data
- [ ] Determine if balance should be user-specific or global
- [ ] Check if frontend properly handles the balance display
- [ ] Verify if the issue is calculation or display

### Files to Examine
- `/src/app/api/dashboard/running-balance/route.ts` - Main balance calculation
- `/src/components/ui/running-balance-widget.tsx` - Display component
- `/src/lib/cost-calculations.ts` - Cost calculation utilities
- Database records for the specific user

### Expected Outcome
Identify why the anticipated payment is -$7.44 instead of a higher amount that properly reflects the 13.5 kWh recent consumption.

## üîç Meter Readings Investigation Plan (July 7, 2025)

### Problem
The dashboard is showing 10.74 kWh consumption for July 1st, and we need to understand what meter readings data is causing this calculation.

### Analysis Tasks

#### 1. Database Schema Analysis
- [x] Reviewed Prisma schema to understand MeterReading and UserContribution models
- [x] Identified that daily consumption is calculated from tokensConsumed field in UserContribution
- [x] Found that MeterReading has userId, reading, readingDate, notes fields
- [x] Noted that UserContribution has meterReading, tokensConsumed, and references a purchase

#### 2. Data Investigation Tasks
- [x] Query all meter readings from June 30 - July 7th timeframe
- [x] Query all user contributions from June 30 - July 7th timeframe  
- [x] Analyze the sequence of readings to identify gaps or irregularities
- [x] Calculate expected daily consumption between readings
- [x] Identify which specific data points are contributing to the 10.74 kWh for July 1st
- [x] Check for multiple contributions on July 1st that might be summing to 10.74 kWh

#### 3. Data Analysis
- [x] Compare actual meter readings vs calculated consumption
- [x] Identify any data inconsistencies or duplicate entries
- [x] Determine if the issue is in data entry or calculation logic
- [x] Document findings with specific meter readings and calculations

#### 4. Reporting
- [x] Provide detailed report of meter readings sequence
- [x] Show expected vs actual consumption calculations
- [x] Recommend next steps for fixing the issue

### Investigation Results

#### Problem Identified
The dashboard showing "10.74 kWh for July 1st" is **MISLEADING**. The 10.74 kWh is not July 1st consumption - it's the **maximum daily consumption** for the current month (July 2nd).

#### Key Findings

1. **No July 1st Data**: No user contributions or consumption data exists for July 1st, 2025
2. **Meter Reading Reality**: 
   - June 30: 250.13 kWh ‚Üí July 1: 254.92 kWh = **4.79 kWh consumption**
   - This is the actual July 1st consumption based on meter readings
3. **Source of 10.74 kWh**: 
   - Max Daily Consumption API calculates this for **July 2nd**
   - Combination of direct consumption (4.79 kWh) + distributed multi-day consumption (5.95 kWh)
   - July 2-5 gap required distribution of 17.86 kWh over 3 days

#### Detailed Consumption Breakdown
- **July 1st**: 4.79 kWh (actual meter reading difference)
- **July 2nd**: 10.74 kWh (4.79 direct + 5.95 distributed) - **MAXIMUM**
- **July 3rd**: 5.95 kWh (distributed from multi-day gap)
- **July 4th**: 5.95 kWh (distributed from multi-day gap)  
- **July 6th**: 4.79 kWh
- **July 7th**: 5.06 kWh

#### API Logic Explanation
The Max Daily Consumption API distributes consumption across days when there are gaps in meter readings:
- Reading gap: July 2 (259.71) ‚Üí July 5 (277.57) = 17.86 kWh over 3 days
- Daily distribution: 17.86 √∑ 3 = 5.95 kWh per day
- July 2nd gets both: 4.79 (direct) + 5.95 (distributed) = 10.74 kWh

#### Dashboard Display Issue
The user interface is showing "July 1st: 10.74 kWh" but this value actually represents:
- **Maximum daily consumption** (10.74 kWh on July 2nd)
- **NOT** the July 1st consumption (which is 4.79 kWh)

#### Recommendations
1. **Fix Dashboard Labels**: Clarify that 10.74 kWh is the maximum daily consumption, not July 1st
2. **Data Accuracy**: The calculations are mathematically correct
3. **UI Improvement**: Better labeling to avoid confusion about which date the values represent

### Technical Notes
- Dashboard API uses UserContribution.tokensConsumed for historical analysis
- Max Daily Consumption API uses MeterReading table for real-time calculations
- No data inconsistencies found - the issue is display/interpretation
