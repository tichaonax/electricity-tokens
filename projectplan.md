- **Historical Analysis**: Smart contribution suggestions based on consumption patterns
- **Audit Compliance**: All constraint violations logged with detailed error messages

### Constraint Implementation Strategy âœ…

The application uses a **hybrid constraint enforcement approach**:

#### Database-Level Constraints (PostgreSQL + Prisma):

- **Referential Integrity**: Foreign key relationships prevent orphaned records
- **Unique Constraints**: One-to-one purchase-contribution relationship via unique `purchaseId`
- **Deletion Protection**: `onDelete: Restrict` prevents cascade deletions of purchases with contributions
- **Data Type Enforcement**: Proper field types (Float, DateTime, Boolean) with NOT NULL constraints

#### Application-Level Constraints (Zod + Business Logic):

- **Value Range Validation**: Min/max limits for tokens, payments, meter readings
- **Positive Number Enforcement**: All monetary and quantity values must be positive
- **Chronological Ordering**: Meter readings must increase over time
- **Token Consumption Logic**: Automatic calculation and validation of token usage
- **Sequential Workflow**: Purchase-contribution ordering enforced in business logic

#### Rationale for Hybrid Approach:

- **Database constraints**: Handle critical referential integrity and prevent data corruption
- **Application constraints**: Provide flexible business rule enforcement with detailed error messages
- **UI constraints**: Deliver immediate user feedback and prevent invalid submissions
- **Performance**: Complex validations in application layer avoid database overhead

### Recently Resolved Constraint Issues âœ…

**Status**: Complete admin purchase recalculation system with automatic contribution updates and comprehensive impact analysis!

### Technical Implementation Details:

#### Purchase Edit API Enhancements (`/api/purchases/[id]/route.ts`):

- **Impact Analysis Function**: Analyzes changes before application to identify affected contributions
- **Automatic Recalculation Logic**: Recalculates `tokensConsumed` based on new meter reading baseline
- **Constraint Validation**: Prevents changes that would violate token limits or create negative consumption
- **Enhanced Response**: Returns recalculation summary with old/new values for transparency

#### Impact Analysis API (`/api/purchases/[id]/impact-analysis/route.ts`):

- **Admin-Only Endpoint**: Provides impact preview functionality for purchase changes
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Shows affected contributions, constraint violations, and change summaries
- **Real-time Validation**: Validates constraints without making actual changes

#### Enhanced Audit System:

- **Cascading Change Logs**: Tracks both primary changes and triggered recalculations
- **Detailed Context**: Records why changes were made and what calculations were affected
- **Integrity Verification**: Maintains audit trail completeness for compliance

#### Business Logic Implementation:

- **Chronological Preservation**: Uses `createdAt` for ordering, meter reading changes don't affect sequence
- **Focused Recalculation**: Only recalculates directly affected contribution, avoiding unnecessary cascading
- **Report Cache Invalidation**: Marks dependent cached reports for regeneration (future implementation)
