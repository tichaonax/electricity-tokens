# Windows Service Migration Plan

## Overview

Migrate from sc.exe command-based Windows service implementation to node-windows package approach for simpler, more robust service management.

## Todo Items

- [x] Analyze current Windows service implementation using sc.exe
- [x] Research existing node-windows usage in codebase
- [x] Remove sc.exe based service files
- [x] Implement new node-windows service approach
- [x] Update package.json dependencies
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new service architecture
- [x] Test the new service implementation

## Implementation Strategy

1. Replace manual sc.exe commands with node-windows Service class
2. Create service installer/uninstaller scripts using node-windows
3. Remove redundant files and update documentation
4. Ensure service auto-restart and monitoring capabilities
5. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Expected Changes

- Remove sc.exe command scripts
- Add node-windows dependency
- Create simplified service management scripts
- Update all related documentation

## Review Summary

### Final Implementation: Hybrid Service Architecture

After extensive testing and troubleshooting, the project successfully implemented a **hybrid service architecture** that combines the best of both node-windows and Windows Service Control Manager:

#### Changes Made

1. **Created hybrid installer (install-service-hybrid.js)**:
   - Uses node-windows to create service files and handle process management
   - Uses sc.exe for proper Windows Service Control Manager registration
   - Ensures service appears in services.msc control panel
   - Provides robust service lifecycle management

2. **Updated package.json**: Made hybrid installer the default method:
   - `service:install` now points to hybrid implementation
   - Retained original pure node-windows as `service:install-old`
   - Added diagnostic and validation scripts

3. **Enhanced environment variable handling**:
   - Added automatic .env.local file loading in config.js
   - Implemented environment variable filtering to prevent undefined values
   - Updated validation scripts to properly detect environment variables

4. **Created comprehensive diagnostic tools**:
   - `diagnose-service.js` for troubleshooting service installation issues
   - Enhanced status checking and process monitoring
   - Better log file analysis and directory verification

5. **Maintained pure node-windows implementation**:
   - Original install-service.js kept as fallback option
   - All sc.exe usage removed from pure implementation
   - Clean separation between hybrid and pure approaches

### Hybrid Architecture Benefits

- **Best of Both Worlds**: Combines node-windows process management with Windows SCM integration
- **Visible in Services.msc**: Service properly appears in Windows Service Control Manager
- **Robust Process Management**: node-windows handles restarts, monitoring, and error recovery
- **Proper Windows Integration**: sc.exe ensures full Windows service registration
- **Environment Variable Management**: Automatic .env.local file loading and validation
- **Comprehensive Diagnostics**: Built-in troubleshooting and validation tools
- **Fallback Options**: Multiple installation methods available for different scenarios

### Key Technical Solutions

1. **Service Registration Issue**: Pure node-windows wasn't registering with Windows SCM
   - **Solution**: Hybrid approach creates node-windows files then registers with sc.exe
2. **Environment Variable Loading**: Variables not being detected from .env.local
   - **Solution**: Added custom environment loading in config.js and validation scripts
3. **Undefined Variables in Service XML**: Service configuration showing undefined values
   - **Solution**: Implemented environment variable filtering in all installers

4. **Service Visibility**: Service not appearing in services.msc control panel
   - **Solution**: Explicit Windows SCM registration via sc.exe after node-windows setup

### Service Features Retained/Enhanced

- ✅ Auto-start on boot
- ✅ Crash recovery with intelligent restart policies
- ✅ Windows Event Log integration
- ✅ Production build automation
- ✅ Environment variable management (.env.local support)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Administrative privilege validation
- ✅ Service status monitoring
- ✅ Easy install/uninstall process
- ✅ Visible in Windows Services Control Manager
- ✅ Comprehensive diagnostic tools

### Final Status: ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The hybrid service implementation successfully resolves all installation and visibility issues. The service:

- Installs correctly and appears in services.msc
- Starts automatically and runs the application
- Provides proper Windows integration
- Maintains node-windows benefits for process management
- Includes comprehensive diagnostic and validation tools
