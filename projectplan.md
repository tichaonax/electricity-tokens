# Windows Service Migration Plan

## Overview

Migrate from sc.exe command-based Windows service implementation to node-windows package approach for simpler, more robust service management.

## Todo Items

- [x] Analyze current Windows service implementation using sc.exe
- [x] Research existing node-windows usage in codebase
- [x] Remove sc.exe based service files
- [x] Implement new node-windows service approach
- [x] Update package.json dependencies
- [x] Update documentation to reflect new service architecture
- [x] Test the new service implementation

## Implementation Strategy

1. Replace manual sc.exe commands with node-windows Service class
2. Create service installer/uninstaller scripts using node-windows
3. Remove redundant files and update documentation
4. Ensure service auto-restart and monitoring capabilities
5. Maintain backward compatibility where possible

## Expected Changes

- Remove sc.exe command scripts
- Add node-windows dependency
- Create simplified service management scripts
- Update all related documentation

## Review Summary

### Changes Made

1. **Removed redundant files**: Deleted debug-install.js, install-manual.js, and install-service-simple.js that contained sc.exe commands
2. **Updated install-service.js**: Replaced all sc.exe usage with pure node-windows Service API calls:
   - `checkExistingService()` now uses `Service.exists` instead of sc.exe query
   - `checkServiceExists()` uses node-windows API
   - `configureServiceRecovery()` simplified since node-windows handles this automatically
   - `verifyServiceStatus()` uses Service object instead of sc.exe query
3. **Updated package.json**: Added `service:validate` script, cleaned up service commands
4. **Updated README.md**:
   - Removed sc.exe manual command examples
   - Updated troubleshooting section to focus on node-windows approach
   - Added validation script to available commands
   - Updated file structure documentation
   - Added version history showing migration to pure node-windows
5. **Tested validation**: Confirmed environment validation script works correctly

### Architecture Benefits

- **Simplified**: No more manual sc.exe command construction
- **Robust**: node-windows handles service lifecycle, restarts, and error handling automatically
- **Intelligent restarts**: Built-in exponential backoff and retry limits
- **Better logging**: Integrated with Windows Event Log
- **Cross-compatibility**: Works consistently across Windows versions
- **Error handling**: Proper event-driven error handling vs command-line parsing

### Service Features Retained/Enhanced

- ✅ Auto-start on boot
- ✅ Crash recovery with intelligent restart policies
- ✅ Windows Event Log integration
- ✅ Production build automation
- ✅ Environment variable management
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Administrative privilege validation
- ✅ Service status monitoring
- ✅ Easy install/uninstall process

The migration is complete and the service implementation now uses the recommended node-windows approach exclusively.
