# Electricity Tokens Tracker - User Manual

## üì± Welcome to Electricity Tokens Tracker

Electricity Tokens Tracker is a modern web application designed to help households and organizations track electricity usage through a token-based system. Each token represents 1 kWh (kilowatt-hour) of electricity, making it easy to understand and manage your energy consumption.

### What is the Token System?

- **1 Token = 1 kWh** of electricity
- **Purchase tokens** in bulk when needed
- **Track individual consumption** using meter readings
- **Calculate fair shares** based on actual usage
- **Monitor costs** and optimize usage patterns

1. **Navigate to Purchase Form**
   - Click "Purchase Form" in the main menu
   - Or use the "+" button on the dashboard

2. **Enter Purchase Details**:
   
   **Total Tokens**: Number of tokens purchased (kWh)

   - Must be a positive number
   
   **Total Payment**: Amount paid in dollars
   - Example: 150.50
   - Include any taxes or fees
   
   **Meter Reading**: Current meter reading when purchase was made
   - Example: 5000
   - This is the starting point for consumption calculation
   
   **Purchase Date**: When the purchase was made
   - Use the date picker
   - Defaults to today

- **Positive values**: All amounts must be greater than zero
- **Reasonable limits**: Maximum 100,000 tokens and $1,000,000 payment
- **Future dates**: Purchase dates cannot be in the future

## üìù Contributing to Purchases

### Understanding Contributions

After someone creates a purchase, each household member needs to:
1. **Record their meter reading** when they check it
2. **Calculate their fair share** based on actual consumption
3. **Pay their contribution** to the person who made the purchase

### How to Contribute

1. **Go to Contribute Page**
   - Click "Contribute" in the main menu
   - Or click "Add Contribution" on dashboard

2. **Select a Purchase**
   - Choose from the dropdown list
   - Recent purchases appear first
   - Purchases with existing contributions are highlighted

3. **Enter Your Information**:

   **Current Meter Reading**: The meter reading you see now
   - Example: 5025 (if purchase was at 5000, you used 25 kWh)
   - Must be higher than the purchase meter reading
   
   **Your Contribution Amount**: How much you're paying
   - System calculates suggested amount based on usage
   - You can adjust if there are special arrangements
   - Example: If you used 25 tokens out of 100, and total cost was $150, your fair share is about $37.50

4. **Review the Calculation**
   - **Tokens Consumed**: Automatically calculated (your reading - purchase reading)
   - **Your Share**: Based on proportional usage
   - **Rate per kWh**: Your effective electricity rate

5. **Submit Contribution**
   - Click "Submit Contribution"
   - Payment details will be logged
   - Original purchaser will be notified

### Contribution Tips

- **Be accurate with meter readings**: Small errors can affect fair cost distribution
- **Contribute promptly**: Don't wait too long after purchases
- **Check suggested amounts**: The system calculates fair shares automatically
- **Communicate with household**: Discuss any special arrangements

## üí° Tips for Efficient Usage

### Best Practices

**Regular Monitoring**:
- Check your meter reading weekly
- Contribute to purchases promptly
- Review monthly reports to identify trends

**Cost Optimization**:
- **Buy in bulk**: Larger purchases often have better rates
- **Avoid emergencies**: Plan purchases before running out
- **Monitor usage**: High consumption periods affect everyone's costs

**Household Coordination**:
- **Communicate**: Discuss usage patterns and costs
- **Plan together**: Coordinate purchases for better rates
- **Be fair**: Contribute based on actual consumption

### Understanding Your Electricity Bill

**Rate Calculation**:
```
Your Rate = Total Payment √∑ Tokens Used
Fair Share = (Your Tokens √∑ Total Tokens) √ó Total Payment
```

**Example**:
- Purchase: 100 tokens for $150
- You used: 25 tokens
- Your fair share: (25 √∑ 100) √ó $150 = $37.50
- Your rate: $37.50 √∑ 25 = $1.50 per kWh
